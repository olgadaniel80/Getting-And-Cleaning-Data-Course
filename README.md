# Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

We get two sets of data - train and test.

Our goal is to join both sets in a one common table and extarct variables with mean or standard deviation.

Also we added variables names from file "features.txt" and labels from "activity_labels.txt".

The next step is to get average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
